I am Stephen Neal a freshman at Allegheny College and want to major in software engineering.  I come from a family of 6.  With me being the youngest of 4 siblings.  I have two brothers and a sister.  I also have 4 dogs who I appreciate very much.  Two of them are boston terriers, one is a white lab, and the other one is a boxer.  


 I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and have lived here my whole life.  The thing I love the most about Pittsburgh Pennsylvania has got to be the sports here.  I have always been a fan of the Steelers, Pirates, and Penguins for as long as I could remember.  Another things I love about Pittsburgh has got to be the atmosphere whether it be going across the Roberto Clemente bridge, or just driving through the city it is always full of exciting sites and views.
