 I have a lot of different hobbies.  These hobbies are spending time with family and hanging with friends, hitting the gym, listening to music, and playing video games.

**Family:**
 
 I come from a family of 6 and have 3 other siblings.  I am of the youngest of 4 as I have 2 brothers and one 1 sister.  

**Gym:**
 
  I started going to the gym in my senior year of highschool and it has impacted me in a lot of ways.  For one you get stronger which just comes for everyone who goes over a period of time.  Another thing I learned is discipline as you set goals, but goals come with obstacles to complete them.  

**Music**

 I listen to music all the time whether I be going to a class, or just with some friends.  My favorite genres of music are hip-hop and RnB.  My favorite hip-hop artists are [Kanye West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAsHVwl-MU4), and [LUCKI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn9A3Ri5DAs).  While my favorite RnB artists are [Frank Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE005nZeF-A), [Brent Faiyaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqR8ictp8Os).

 **Video Games**

 In my spare time I will play video games.  I have played them ever since I was young and that hasn't changed.  My favorite games are Cyberpunk 2077, and Call of Duty Black ops 2.
