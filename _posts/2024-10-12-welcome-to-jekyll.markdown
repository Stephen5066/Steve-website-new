 I have a lot of different hobbies.  These hobbies are spending time with family and hanging with friends, hitting the gym, listening to music, and playing video games.

 I come from a family of 6 and have 3 other siblings.  I am of the youngest of 4 as I have 2 brothers and one 1 sister.  Its always to get time with family since I am the youngest and my other siblings moved out, and I am away at college so we never really get to see each other anymore, so I always value the time I get with them.  The same thing goes with my friends back home.  It is hard to balance college life with my college friends and back home friends.

 I started going to the gym in my senior year of highschool and it has impacted me in a lot of ways.  For one you get stronger which just comes for everyone who goes over a period of time.  Another thing I learned is discipline as you set goals, but goals come with obstacles to complete them.  It also was a way to spend time with my dad and brother.  We would always go together and we kept each other on track.

I listen to music all the time whether I be going to a class, or just with some friends.  My favorite genres of music are hip-hop and RnB.  My favorite hip-hop artists are Kanye West, and LUCKI.  While my favorite RnB artists are Frank Ocean, Brent Faiyaz.

 In my spare time I will play video games.  I have played them ever since I was young and that hasn't changed.  My favorite games are Cyberpunk 2077, and Call of Duty Black ops 2.
