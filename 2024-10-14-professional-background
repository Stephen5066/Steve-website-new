## Coding Background

I am relatively new to coding with Document Engineering being my first ever coding class.  I have some experience with Visual Studio, Git, GitHub, and expierence with using markdown format.


## Work Experience

I have experience in a few other fields with no relation to coding.  I have been working ever since I was around 14 years old

#### Volunteers of America

Volunteers of America is a non profit organization that focuses on helping those in need and is spread out through America.  My location is a small building where I work at an after school program.  In this program I am a educational aid to students.  I would also help coordinate activites for these students.  I have been working here for 4 years.

#### HomeGoods

I started HomeGoods a little before winter my senior year of highschool around November.  I needed the extra cash at the time and they were hiring, so I sent in my application.  I got the job and I would mostly be in the back and I would build furniture to be out onto the sales floor helping customers or stocking shelves.

#### Game Management Work Study

At Allegheny I have a work study.  I have always been a sports fan and have enjoyed watching sports and I wanted to be involved with athletics when working at Allegheny.  Thats why I selected this job.  My job duties just involve preparing games, so setting up the fields, or I would guide game officials or the away teams to their locker rooms.  I would than also help close up everything when the game is over.
